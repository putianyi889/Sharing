Ok, I may have a seed, but its a slight sketch. enchanted shrine within
first 30 seconds of spawn, with another 30 seconds to get double jump, 2
hearts, lead, gold and ruby. The only problem i see is bee and tp pots,
both of which would require some digging/blowing up to get to them. but
the icing on this sketch cake is the dungeon, golden key accessible at
the very top (as in surface room chest), and muramasa is super close to
the entrance.

I found the god seed for corruption. triple orb, right "below it" is the
sword shrine, at the other end of this corruption is a chest with 2
teleport pots and 3 ruby. on the way to the tp pots, are the two hearts.
while this corruption is right next to the dungeon, which is farther
inland than usual, the jungle on the right side has a surface bee hive.
about damnt time. 4 hours of searching

you must have a timer
please, for the love of god. Use a timer.
there are like 50 million of them and they're extremely easy to use and
will get your runs submitted MUCH faster as I don't have to do all this
weird stuff to see how long your time is. You'll also want this as a
runner as it helps you set a time line for your run

there is potential for video splicing, and music can heal that overlap

Dr.Robotnik 08-May-18 06:01 AM
ok, a few notes that make me really question the run. 1: a single
teleport to get to hell and where he wanted to go. 2: the instant
plantera, while not impossible, is questionable and for this reason 3:
He is using seedless..... with no minimap? yet finds everything in a
zoomed in screen? 4: mechanical skull drop is 1:2500, and the attempt
was deliberate. 5: while double voodoo doll is possible (i have a clip
of it happening to me the other day) it is incredibly rare. 6: his
movement and digging shows deliberation seen on seeded, and yet hes
rarely forced to stop to deal with enemies? 7: while not having full
equipment (wall spikes, boots, etc) and comming across them, he opens
chests and immidiately grabs the items he wants (gold and vision items)
and doesnt even check the items which could boost dps? My conclusion: A
Billy Mitchel/Todd Rodgers scenario. What we cant see, we cant know, and
have to take face value. Face value already has shade on him, which
leads me to believe this is faked.

pretty recent of a mod that the page was just updated again april 28th.

BandsWithLegends 08-May-18 08:10 AM
that run is so awesome. If there was any kind of mod you would see it at
the end when they go to the main menu. There is always the argument of
video splicing, but this is impossible to tell in this scenario, so I
will go with the "innocent until proven guilty" aspect of this. This
person has show immense skill in the past and now for how they play
Terraria. They have immensely tight technical play and have studied the
game to an insanely close detail to be able to predict and implement an
amazing strategy. Any accusations or suggestions of cheating will be
taken very seriously, so you better be able to back them up if you do
them. Do not do them publicly without extremely solid proof that it's
happening. "This run is really good and everything goes right for this
person" is the worst kind of reasoning. Recognize the amount of time and
study this person has applied to the game. I'm not defending this person
in particular, because I can't completely say whether or not what
they're doing is or isn't cheating, but I'm defending the ability for
immense amounts of time and effort to produce what can be unreal
results. I've done things in my life which some people would call
perfection, and their approach is very indicative of someone who has
spent numerous hours perfecting themselves and their strategy. Again,
you can never be 100% sure, but there is nothing in this video to
indicate any level of this has been fabricated. If you have other
evidence, please let me know. But, until then, congratulate them on
their awesome work and awesome run, and learn from all of the incredible
things they're doing and use them to better yourself. GGs!

I completely agree with bands, if there is no proof apart from the fact
they did well then it was probably real. They were grinding for quite a
long time, so they would‚Äôve eventually got insane rng. From the small
bit i‚Äôve seen the only ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of it being cheated is no raw footage.

Saying they grinded for a long time is still just taking their word for
it when there is no online presence or even mention of doing the run.
Innocent until proven guilty is always good, but I also think fanfare
and praise until verification is wise. While it will be cool to think
this run is legit, I‚Äôll likely reserve myself until we see an unedited
video. The footage did kind of give me some idea about hardmode
techniques (edited)

They have an online presence. This person doesn't upload often, but they

They're always producing quality content that they have clearly
mastered. I really suggest you check out the rest of their youtube
content to see the kinds of things they can do. They've done night 1
expert mode skeletron without mine cart and/or invincibility. They
developed the dynamite strategy for expert WoF. I really suggest you do

They didn't use an inventory editor for the watch, they just went into a
different world and grabbed one, the watch is the least of my concern.
Technically, you could not do this if you wanted to upload it to
speedrun.com, as it doesn't have a timer and the character isn't a
'fresh' character, but they aren't uploading it to our site and aren't
following our rules, but that doesn't mean they haven't done something

aim pattern is mystery for me

Dr.Robotnik 08-May-18 10:33 AM
Odd note. Why does he unspawn the stardust dragon partway through the
fight and then summon it back once ml is dead. I get that the hands
destroyed means that more attacks will come, and that constant damage
from the dragon may prevent him from hitting it with his Melee weapon,
but to stop when their are still multiple targets to hit just seems odd.

Maybe it was not intended to use at all and they noticed it only after a
while, not sure tho I'd have unsummoned it asap just to not screw with
Solar Eruption iframes
Might as well talk about why not focus main eye all the time just to
shave some time since it is pretty much a cap to how fast you kill ML
due to long invincibility period
Yet again, there is a strat of assigning eye cycles one by one, might be
screwing with what I thought above

if you havent done any speedruns yourself
@Dr.Robotnik can you summarise everything and give me 3 most heavy
reasons why you think the run wasnt legit?
and you also said, believing that it took 10 months is "taking their
word for it", while i 100% believe this just from seeing the
micromovement during the first half of the run, inventory management,
adaptation to the terrain and finding a good use for every random drop
i've had mech boss summons drop multiple times from the first kingslime,
had 4 woodoo demons spawn within 1 minute. So im waiting for your
response (edited)

You probably messed up smth I am for this run being legit, I do bring
out some points that may not be obvious but almost always destroy them
myself Also that "no runs" thing. Don't need to be a bank manager to say
something is financial pyramid
My thoughts on risk-reward **can** be wrong,I think I pointed it out
with my expressions
Ngl I feel like you are a bit enthusiastic at defending this speedrun,
while I may say offensive accusations but didn't meant them to be my
main flow
Sorry if something, I'm just confused
And yeah, gotta say this again, whether or not this speedrun was legit
(and I wish it is legit), Ningishu's perfomance was beyond one's
comprehension

Dr.Robotnik 08-May-18 08:18 PM
Thanks for that clarification @Max Overpower\#5914 on the moon lord
fight. I had a feeling that was the case, as previously mentioned, but
hearing it from you is good. As far as legitimacy for the run goes, I‚Äôll
try to sum up the notes I had previously mentioned as well as counter
points to accreditation. To say they got this from their grind over 10
months has no backing other than taking their word for it. The lack of
knowledge of who has even done a run this fast is evidence supported by
a statement on their twitter about a month ago when supposedly they
completed the run. To say they worked on this run for 10 months without
looking up some sort of run and adapting and improving strategy done by
current runners, as implied by lack of even the fastest time done by
runners, is extremely suspicious. Next, the micromanagement of drops and
movements. The movements hands down are legit. I‚Äôve seen enough of this
player to know they do have a great understanding for the game, and have
seen how well they move and deal with things. However, this does play
into understanding exactly what you would need to complete the game
fast, and the execution to pull it off and make it seem believable.
Single teleport to hell, moving around zoomed in and no minimal yet
destroying and gathering items below them they shouldn‚Äôt be able to see
or know is there, the extreme item drops all in one run on top of it
all.
Lastly, to pull all of this off with a good mod requires 1 last
component, being a good editor/graphic designer. To this credit, they
are incredibly talented. It wouldn‚Äôt be too much of a stretch that
editing out the main menu screen, editing the fact it‚Äôs random seed to
start, or anything else with a screen change (like teleporting) would be
hard for them to do. This leads me to my last point: the stop watch.
This item would allow you to piece together segments and make them seem
believable, and would also allow you to reattempt things such as
teleporting to hell, going for plantera, and getting rare drops. While I
think seeing the raw video will clear some things up, in the research I
have done to come to a logical conclusion I have seen some things that
would be able to hide from sight such as item drops. Being proven wrong
here would honestly be amazing, because through rose tinted glasses,
this run optimized so much for things that are pretty undeveloped. I
myself have been apart of a dramatic change to how the runs are done, so
it‚Äôs not unreasonable to think the run is legit, especially with the
clear knowledge of the game the person has demonstrated on the channel.
But just as Todd Rodgers and Billy Mitchel showed true prowess in their
craft, it is possible for this incredible run to be fake. To be
absolutely clear. I am not one way or another. I do not side with real
or fake. I do however judge things critically that are not easily proven
legitimate with current evidence. Let us hope this person comes forward
soon and opens the curtains to ultimately reveal the legitimacy of this
run.
Sorry for the wall.

if i did a run that went for at least 20 minutes with zoomed in screen,

moonlord
until we get more updates, like unedited footage, i think we should end
the topic

I agree, really everything is just speculation until we have concrete
unedited footage.
on a different subject, still regarding the video, is there a hardmode
weapon that allows you to just walk through enemies without getting
hurt? he walks through several slimes during the cultist fight. first i
thought it may just be a knockback thing, but he doesnt take damage or
make a pain sound either. i figure its one of the boss accessories but
im unsure
nvm, was able to find it on my own. royal gel

I know the music was edited afterwards, you can tell because the boss
music doesnt play when he fights king slimes and the music doesnt get
faster when he speeds things up. He using some other modified/remixed
track that I can't quite find. He uses the same music in his wall of

I don't know if they made it themselves or something

rhombu 09-May-18 01:04 AM
Anyways, another question. Is there any method to get blocks that
require a high pickaxe efficiency but can't be blown up? For example,
the desert fossils. I ask this because on the 908319048, if you jump
down the pit in the desert, you land right on some desert fossils. If
you could acquire it somehow, you should be able to easily get fossil
armor and weapons with the extractinator found in the chest along with
teleport potions. The fossil armor / weapons would make the queen bee
fight faster because of the superior dps, and potentially save time
later with the beenades, since they do throwing damage and would get a
boost from the fossil armor
The problem is that they require the corruption/crimson pickaxe or
better to get, and I can't find an easy way to acquire those or a better
pickaxe, while also being faster than just fighting the queen bee the
regular way with the enchanted sword
The hellstone pickaxe is out of the picture since hellstone requires the
corruption/crimson pick to get it, and also can't be blown up (except
after hardmode is activated)
So I think you would either have to go to the crimson to get tissue
samples for a pick, or get a reaver shark. I highly doubt either of
those options are faster than just using the enchanted sword though
Unless there's a way to break the blocks outside of using a pickaxe or
bomb

if breaking pots didnt net you bombs honestly

Dr.Robotnik 09-May-18 02:16 AM
nvm, it cant be
lol i just checked after i typed
was curious if it had the same properties as hellstone, meaning you
could bomb them once in hardmode, but that doesnt seam to be the case
the only other thing i guess i would recommend, and it pertains more
towards the ml or all boss route, is fishing for a reaver shark, which
would be capable of mining it
honestly speaking, if you ran for crates early, and tried to both obtain
the wooden crate and this, that would be a low time reset strat with
high end possibilities (edited)

I was mostly looking for ways to kill the queen bee faster, since that

queen bee in ml runs?

depends on the seed really
the route is super unrefined as only 2-3 people actually run it. i mean,
look how different ningishu is from our normal route. no bee, no crates,
no dupe and on expert (if all legit that is).
still, arkhalis is going to be the fastest weapon to kill bee
the dps and early access to it just makes it optimal

for mid air dodging and over all jump distance yes. if you build a
platform bridge, even just 1 long one, you could use grapple to pull
your self out of the way and launch high, than when he shoots, just
holding down will allow you to dodge the skulls and not have to worry
about fall damage

Speedrun.com is grass roots by nature. that being said it would need a
following of runners to support it. we are seeing a boom in terraria
speed running lately, which is great, so i would say if enough people
want it and do runs for it, where is the harm. But im not a mod, but
logically I think thats how @BandsWithLegends would feel about it.

Mods are on my list
but
Even if speedrun.com is just from the game alone.
or "grass roots"
i think some changes could be made to make it slightly better
like. Anything can be better if you know what that is
My opinion is that adding mods would be a more widespread of runs. Maybe
a category that matches what people are looking for
Don't get me wrong, Speedrun.com is amazing how it is right now
Theres always room for improvement.

not to mention ML isnt immune to Daybroken, which with how fast the
solar eruption hits, stacking all 8 (for a total of 200 life gone a
second) on him is pretty quick
using this in normal and not expert would allow for an arena change to
prevent the hands from hitting you as well

for loot. If the time of such splits is worthy enough, why not take it
in related category?

they want those records, they can submit any valid run they'd like to
claim them. I'd be happy to validate any of them

some people think that they should have an individual run specifically

really up to them and what records they want and how they feel

the thing is crabbar, is that a casual run of this game is usually super

wsplit allows you to keep it in the front during full screen. problem
because terraria doesnt lock the mouse its game when in full screen, you
can click on the timer and it will minimize your game. if you are
looking to stream but only have one monitor and want to monitor it, make
it super tiny on your screen, but keep it large on the obs capture.

In my last practice run it took me something like 4 or 5 minutes to find

My best advice is to really take advantage of the one thing that sets
you apart from the enemies you're fighting. The ability to place blocks.
Actually one of the most powerful things you can do in Terraria. You can
avoid pretty much every enemy early game by just placing blocks until
you get a weapon you can defend yourself with

But the gist of it is a door, block on top of the door, then a platform
to the side of the block. Hammer that into a slope. Put the block you
want to dupe on the platform. Open and close the door by clicking on the
top part of the door

Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 08:58 AM
Hey @BandsWithLegends I just noticed something a little odd about some
of the runs and i want your take on the ruling (being a mod for the
boards and all) So time is suppose to start when you gain control of the
character, but ive noticed a few runs where time starts this way, and
the 11:15 night time for some runners is starting as soon as 11:12 on
their timer, giving them a pretty significant edge for skeletron/ eye.
So my question is, in runs that involve this, which is all of the main
category runs, should time be adjusted for this discrepancy.
This is kind of important, as this will put @tvgBadger in first for all
pre-hardmode bosses seeded normal
I feel like a ruling on this could be important, as runners with poor
computer/ internet speed going into multiplayer (the load times only
effect multiplayer as you load a server) could get a pretty large
advantage
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/149765252068671491/e2b8a5d5b677fe8cdbc55ddcae94b62d.png)
BandsWithLegends 10-May-18 09:03 AM
this definitely happens. It's when you're using multiplayer and the
server starts before you enter the world. We could move the start time
to when it says "starting server" for multiplayer runs. It never used to
be this close, but as things become tighter and tighter we might have to
move to that model.
Good eye, I'll chat it up with the other mods and see how they feel
about it ![üòÉ](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png "üòÉ")

sounds good. it doesnt affect me directly, but i noticed the level run

this. would bet skeletron is the same way

BandsWithLegends 10-May-18 09:05 AM
I did notice this in a particular run that was submitted recently, the
runner was able to start the fight +2 seconds earlier, which could be
important now that the runs are so close now. They used to be separated
by many minutes, so it wasn't a worry. It's also possible we just adjust
the times based on night, as most of these runs are just waiting for
night to start

Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 09:08 AM
another of max's runs, the skeletron, is early too
thats what i was meaning, which really does effect all major run
categories, but if people do level for eye and skeletron, night time and
a timer on the video needs to be a requirement for verification. Kind of
nice though that were getting enough runners, and refined enough for
this to be a thing

well, you could just do it so whenever they summon the boss, that's

This run you talk about was most likely mine. I did mention it in video

I guess best bet would be starting timer at Starting server.. -\> Found
server point Or, well, using timer as a clock and manually adjusting
time to 11:15 when night falls in final result calculation
~~just prohibit server use /s~~

again crab, it's not about 1 person or 1 run. I'm sure it's happened to
about 95% of the people in this forum. It's about what we should do
about it, should we have to do anything. Even at the starting server
point could be inaccurate, as you'd be relying on someone to know
exactly when the server timer starts, which I don't htink would be
perfect. It'd be interesting to look at other games that possibly have
this issue and to rely on other's experience.

Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 09:35 AM
it honestly doesnt need to be that complicated, and is only a concern
for those fights looking to go right on the dot of 11:15. so if you
started the fight at 11:13 and ended time at 11:43, time real time would
be 11:45 for finish. As far as other categories go, like ML and all
bosses, there is other strats that could prevent you from starting
Skeletron at 11:15, and i would argue being particular about the start
time then doesnt matter.

I mentioned radical method with only singleplayer world but it will
destroy most runs as they are based on dupes Honestly time adjustment
feels the most fine for me, we don't have to blindly follow timer result
as it is good measure of seconds but is flawed on start/end
Ngl preemptive timer launch and then custom split for when you get
character control would be good too
Altho it would be needed only for day runs

and make a decision, but I would like to know everyone's opinions, as
this is about community about coming to the most reasonable conclusion

The other interesting thing is that starting at server start would be a
little easier once you gained control of your character, one less button
to hit in game and possibly miss by a small amount. We'd need to do some
research for exactly when the server timer started though

intentionally tanking their machine during world load a potential
strategy. Seems absolutely miserable

yeah, that was the problem i thought about, you could lag switch the
game hard and get a good 5 seconds, which is a lot to these runs now

I'm glad you all are reasonable on that fact. I ran DmC Devil May Cry
for a while, the \#1 of that game for speedrun.com absolutely refused
all requests to run IGT instead of RTA, even though someone was actively
putting in work for an auto splitter/load pauser.
Currently the WR belongs to someone with an SSD, so rip, lol

The only one I need to look at now is brain. She has that clone/fake
move, but I am curious if the AI is different. See when she is in second
faze when you can actually hit the brain, she will always spawn in the
open and not behind a wall, so pathing her in a corridor you can keep
bee Damage at max, so I‚Äôm curious if during her clone attack if the real
one will be in the path too
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/3.png)

Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 12:07 PM
If she spawns behind a wall, my strat will get me killed
But if it works, it will mean I can kill slime and brain at the same
time like I do already since the hitstun from the beenades are enough to
keep her back

as far as i remember brain can tp inside blocks, but i could be wrong
are you gonna kill expert queen bee with just the stars from starfury?

platform arena instead

I feel like there is some kind of block placement to abuse qb ai but as
far as I tested she either has ability to shoot you or sits in you
Altho I know there is a way to put bee in stasis if doing certain moves
when she tries to spawn bees It is either circling her with enough
vertical mobility or using v shape railroad

Bee will fly as high as she can above you. Thing is she does too much
damage in expert for my arena style to work on her
If you had a bridge about 7 tiles above you, you could throw sticky
bombs up and kill her that way
Or tnt
Either works
But she could just chose to go around you and be dumb and all would be
for naught.

the problem with stars is that when low hp, bee queen spawns bees at a
rate of 4 per second or so, and maybe if lucky you will be able to kill
one third of them with stars, and then you have to melee the rest, while
she is probably charging at you every half a second, making you
basically have to stop damaging her until the pattern changes
i've had expert bee queen change from spawning bees to charging, again
and again for over a minute, thats the worst pattern, unlike normal

My take on when the timer should start: On a multiplayer world, it shold
be in relation to a singleplayer world. So whatever the time is on a
singleplayer world by nightfall, timer for multiplayer should start in
accordinace with that
I think a new world starts on 8:30??
nightfall is always 7:30

In solo, for me, yes
In multiplayer we gotta test it
But i'm sure there no time difference
Except if what i said above is true
I dont think there's some vsync/frameskip going onto a server

until recently i was sure that without frame skip, on a laggy
multiplayer server you would just go slowmotion, then teleport,
sometimes literally walking 3 times as slow. And with frame skip - you
would just lose frames, but recently at one point in my test stream with
1080p and 60 fps i had that slow motion after joining the world even
with frame skip on

i played on a multiplayer server hosted with terrariaserver.exe (i
think?) for like 500 hours, the host was always playing in slow motion,
while others werent, so that doesnt share. And also that bug where
server has to be restarted for someone to connect twice we had during 2p
run with Badger, it was very common back then too
we restarted server for every harddupe LUL
its not even that you cant connect twice, sometimes server just decides
to not let anyone in, not even the host

yeah, if you get the pink slime you should be making Molotov cocktails,

be tnt, and i cant see any fight other than wof for prehardmode tnt is

hey guys..... what about Boulders?
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/200602635714297856/b6356ced20be15c58bb8bb178e72e52c.png)
Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 10:54 PM
Ok, I need advice from some veteran players who know their way around
glitches. Boulders would absolutely quick kill any boss, best part is
they do about 150 damage(also they do double damage in expert), and
pierce all objects. While using them for hardmode wouldnt be much of a
stretch as goblin army has more time to arrive, I feel if you could find
a way to mine the boulders in world traps, you could effectively kill
every boss this way efficiently except for maybe wof.
@tvgBadger @BandsWithLegends @Max Overpower
an idea I had for getting them wont really work for prehardmode as you
wont have the mechanic until after you kill skeletron, meaning you
couldnt do what ningishu does to get golem alter (if that even works on
the boulders)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/200602635714297856/b6356ced20be15c58bb8bb178e72e52c.png)
Dr.Robotnik 10-May-18 11:21 PM
So as it stands now, the single fastest way to beat the eye/skel/and all
prehardmode bosses runs, involve beating the goblin invasion, finding
the GT and than making an expansive boulder trap and instant killing
eye/skeletron. for level objective, its not too bad, but for all
prehardmode bosses, its an incredibly tight run adding this element, as
the only way to get goblin invasion that early to my knowledge is with a
summon as they only spawn at dawn.

laggy setups

Dr.Robotnik 11-May-18 12:29 AM
I mean, as far as hardmode goes, it would likely be better to do
explosives instead, but the damage from traps is crazy. its just a shame
that to get any other traps would require the mechanic, meaning you
would have to kill skeletron making anything else unviable unless there
is a way to trick the game to thinking their is wiring, but seeing as
wiring is a separate layer altogether, its unlikely. theoretically, you
replace naturally spawned traps and place more traps along the wire line
already there to quick kill some bosses, like bee, eye, brain and king
slime, but that still leaves the problem of skeletron

You can place boulders and have them roll.
You need the tinker table to make them
they always roll left, so just placing them is good enough
no wires needed

Dr.Robotnik 11-May-18 01:00 AM
they do roll left, but if you put a block to the left, or falling on the
left most tile, they will go to the right
but yeah, thats why i was saying you could use boulders for the boss
kills. worth mentioning as well, if placed on platforms instead of
blocks, if you just hit the bottom boulder with a pick axe they will
fall through the platform.

test falling damage vs rolling damage

where would be the reasoning to go look somewhere else for the rules
when there are "rules" tab on every run.

The real reason to not use it is because it's a pain to switch around
the computer clocks (as you found out yourself) and it messed with
twitch/youtube/other programs. If there was a good strategy within that
part of the game, I would hate to put people through it when they run,
and it's barely even part of the game, honestly. It's for like 3 weeks
out of the year you get the holiday stuff

I mean, thats no issue to the mods though, and with a lot of people

BandsWithLegends 11-May-18 08:06 AM
It's not a core feature of the game at all. It's a holiday themed event.
And it's not about the mods, it's about the runners and the viewers.
We're all part of the community and all have to go through these things.
We decided as a community that if there are better strats involved in
the holiday event, that it wouldn't be worth the time and effort to
change all of the clocks to do speedruns. Not only is it a pain for the
runner, but viewers would also be confused about the event items. Also,
it's really rare someone can say they have their own 'seed, work, and
strat' All of the knowledge we used is based off of other people's
knowledge. Even more so, it's based off of Re-Logic's game. None of us
created Terraria, we're only playing it. And there's a good chance that
the strategy you're using came from a synthesis of strategies made by
other people. We all work off of each other's knowledge to build, grow,
and improve times. Everyone can use every strategy available in the
rules, no one owns them.

@tvgBadger i just ended an all bosses run, no plantera bulb found with
terramap, then i left the world open for 10 minutes to see where it
spawns, left, found one with terramap, logged in with singleplayer - it
didnt show it on the map, then in multiplayer - didnt show it either,
when i came to that place, there was a bulb (edited)
any idea why my map didnt update properly in multiplayer, while it
should?

all bosses, not so much lately but the rate the scene is exploding we
will have more runs done soon
its nice to see the boards filling up
had a question im unsure and unable to test. i know that each person in
a multiplayer run needs to set up a dupe station, but at what point does
the station have to be for each player. I ask because i think it could
be possible to have one person do the route and have the other set up
everything else to speed up time. wondering if you could do all but the
last sets (frame on top of 2 ore on top of table) an than have the other
person break the table and place the frame and have a working station.
it does take more time passing items back and forth to get dupe done,
but in addition to having the 1 person set up the dupe station, you
could have them locate wormhole potions

Max Overpower 12-May-18 10:45 AM
if i understood what robotnik said correctly, yes, dupe stations can be
set up by 1 player, the other person just has to activate the frame, be
it by using a campfire or placing the second frame
i guess a convenient way to do it would be to have a campfire, one
player would build his duping frame to the left of it, the other to the
right

u using dynamite?
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/3.png)

depends on the seed
if i get 2 dynamite then i will
if i can get a get a queen bee dead than ill do that

if u kill queen be, then i assume that you gotta set up dupe glitch in

right?

whereas if u have beenades, and water walking, then you can just fight
em
maybe even feather fall pot works

for any of the short runs i guess the best way to do it would be to do 3
rounds, maybe even make a point system where youd get 3 points for first
place, 2 points for second and 1 for third
because races are for competition after all
and 4 out of 5 players may just not have 2 dynamite in 1 half of their
worlds' chests, or in case of demolishionist strat, may not get him in
the first 2 days ![ü§∑](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f937.png "ü§∑")

it appears, unicorns can spawn during night too, its just that they are
rare and during night time theres a lot of other spawns that reduce the
chance of unicorn even more

First time doing a seeded run: Why aren't chests, etc. in their places
the second time you create the world?
also chest contents are varied

Its a glitch. you gotta relog terraria
ive had it happen a few times, if you accidentally paste text into the
seed generator, even once, the game just seems to have a hard time
afterwards. Ive had chests just completely vanish from the world but the
terrain be unchanged.

not change, just glitched. i mean there still are random things that can
generate when you make a world, like houses. on an unseeded run i had a
living tree with 3 houses in it, when i went to check the seed out
later, found out 2 of them were random generated in.
stuff can make things like railroads or trees not spawn

if you paste in text

Dr.Robotnik 16-May-18 10:27 PM
so for unseeded all prehardmode bosses, is there any other route than
just going straight for jungle or snow biome to fight bee? thought maybe
a underground with finding gravitation potion coupled with the EoC and
seeking out a starfury for bee. ive been testing out seeds and it seems
only like 1/10 seeds dont have a starfury.
not only that, but finding the ruby in a snow biome (after running king
slime about 50 times) is really unlikely, and jungle is a nightmare when
dealing with enemies.

But yes, you should always consider your options when running unseed

Starfury is neat idea for queen bee as I think about it as it has high
base damage which deals with growing defense of damaged bee
P sure it eats like half the potential of platinum bow/jester arrows at
the end

its a pretty consistent weapon for sticky bomb summon to spawn honestly
and the combo of the sword swing and penetrating star helps deal with
the bee spawns, keeping you from having to stop attacking the queen to
kill the small bees

Lol
at any rate, its something to consider when adapting to finding a
gravitation potion when doing regular cavern drop. there are a few
weapons that work for melee arena against bee too, but a little more
difficult to acquire. another method im looking at right now is adapting
to using a counter weight against bee (from the underground merchant),
not to mention finding him means you can quickly set up the duping
station as he makes spawns almost stop completely.

@CrabBar Starfury is a really really nice choice for QB.
\>Find snow cavern \>no luck for fast snowball cannon \>get gravitation
potion + bombs \>Go to your jungle \>on your way destroy one orb (if you
can) and check for islands You have at least the gun from the orb. Maybe
you will get a starfury, maybe you'll get a shotgun
Were you all reseting pre HM unseed runs when not getting instant
shotgun or snowball cannon ?
200 knives ultra fast QB = very long trip for shotgun/musket
in time I mean

Damn I can't farm my truffle worm
It's so weird, My farm spawns something like 60% of underground monsters
and only 40% of mushroom biome mobs
So truffle worm are like super rare. And I can't use a zerg potion
otherwise every worm will get killed by friendly fire D: (edited)

i think starfury even against normal queen bee would take like 4-5
minutes, if you're only hitting it with stars. Don't see it even being
possible to kill expert bee with just starfury (edited)

when theres 10 bees after you, a single swing kills 2-3 i believe
if bee queen is also doing the dash attacks while youre trying to get
rid of bees its almost impossible to survive

At least you won't need to focus bees separately and you most likely get
hit by them due to server inconsistence anyway

Even with shurikens only it takes about 3 minutes tops (with bad RNG)

1:01 for QB starfury + shurikens 1:36 for QB with shurikens only

honestly though, you really only need tnt/bombs, gold, lead/iron, ruby,
and a close alter. not finding bars means you gotta get ore and stone
which is a pain. you honestly dont even need hearts since rope/chest/
tnt strat is so busted
its faster than killing with beenades

crab bar, wtf is going on with the seed you used for KS
out of interest i wanted to see it in terramap, generated 4 times now
and each one is different
the houses you have in your run are not there, and sometimes the gem
isnt their. the rail tracks go in all sorts of weird directions too.

Omg, I think i understand whats going on @CrabBar, but id like someone
more experienced to confirm what im saying here. It seems that worlds
generated normal, will stay the same in expert, but worlds generated
with expert are different in normal. I also think this is why you only
took the expert run and not both. @Max Overpower or @tvgBadger or
@BandsWithLegends can any of you confirm this?

I honestly forgot about normal lel
@Dr.Robotnik
Also yeah, for some odd reason expert worlds generate really different
from normal ones despite the same seed. iirc world evil change for
example affects only said biomes and probably what they touch
I mean, if it succeeds at generating 2+ pretty different variations with
same settings, no wonder it spazzes out even more when variables change

i was actually just checking that out. ran my seed that i do for my

trees, crim/corruption and houses change, but static chests and their
contents stay the same and all the blocks not affected by previous
changes stay the same.
also the dungeon completely changes which is odd

..... arkhalis is a 1/10 chance from coming from the sword shrine. if
you are curious about specific item spawns, a good place to confirm them
is going to be the wiki. if you cant find the answer there than asking
is your next best bet.

@tvgBadger You should add the autopause fishing glitch to your playlist
\>select your fishing pole in your hotbar
\>put autopause on
\>go to the right of a pool of water
\>open inventory \>throw one item and exit the inventory (edited)
idk why the game make you use the item (TWICE) you have in your hands
when throwing an other item (edited)
Note that with frame skip on you need to wait some frames before you can
select your item to throw
Caution not to quit inventory while holding an object tho
(It's obviously solo only and may not be worth using on long runs)
It would be only worth to use if you get a large pool of water next to
your spawn (edited)

From what i understand this happens to summons as well, the fact you
were double jumping may have something to do with it and the game just
wasnt sure if you were supposed to be on the ground or in the air so you
carried your distance. its happened to me a few times but idk, just a
guess

When were item frames introduced? The current dupe glitch must've been
around since then
So I really doubt it will be fixed next update
Just because of it's mechanic
Even tho the have fixed the previous dupe and multiple infinite house
designs

Item Frames are 1.1 thing iirc, but placeable bars were only introduced
in 1.3 so glitch reveal was severely delayed

If you were ningishu, id recommend going for an uzi (1% drop from angry

Dr.Robotnik 23-May-18 11:41 PM
so i actually did the math...... CAR actually has a higher dps still
the 3 burst shot vs 1 shot/damage of the highest amo obtainable
the laser rifle actually crushes them both and penetrates two targets
(total of 3) which would make it the best for the long category as you
could actually kill skeletron and eye at the same time, making sub 11:40
possible (as you would need to have a dupe station set up at skeletron
and have 2 stars spawn to dupe and get full mana)
but for expert where even getting to this point is damn hard (11:15
spawn time) it would be reliable to kill them both with laser rifle
although, there would be a way round this for prehardmode. jungle set
would give 80 mana and reduce mana usage by 1/7. conversely, you could
use a diamond robe and kill tim and get the hat. the set bonus from
those and natural stats would give 140 mana, reduce mana usage by 15%
and increase crit chance by 10% and leaves open for boots adding another
20 mana in.

Dr.Robotnik 24-May-18 12:11 AM
damn, well as much as i love the penetrating shot and better dps, there
just isnt a way to support continuous fire of the gun. with pot/armor
and best modifier, i was only able to take eye to half health. mind you
it took only like 6 seconds, which means while you could beat eye faster
with continuous fire by a few seconds, you wouldnt be able to support
the continuous fire.
so CAR is legit the best option

The default "use item" is space ??
That's weird, I have no memories about using an item with "space"

i think that maybe because gameplay controls override them
i actually want to know more about this
because in that mode a lot of things dont have anything bound

idk about the damage, but the star are fast enough to catch up to the
eye. You could also mine a hole with dynamite to have the eye in the map
longer

Well, apparently I did some math, and seems like if there is archery

they have limited range), and also adjust for weird arc on distance,
titanium repeater could be as effective as rifle while being less rng

We need to soft-TAS this game.
XNA framework is easy to deal with
And there's already TmodLoader for easing the code
We only need frame advance, save states and some way to force drops from
mobs.
(and force spawn)

Awesome!
When did you kill EoW and Skeletron?
I havet trouble getting my loot and being early for them
I want to be at the dungeon at 11:15 in time for skeleton, so whens the
best time to recall out of the caves to dupe, and kill eater?

I think you should worry about skeletron last
Bombs + Shurikens \> EoW \> Jungle \> Hell \> Dungeon
I melt my demonite bars in hell (and I carry an anvil)
If you get a legendary prefix on your Fiery Greatsword you can melt the
skeletron

alright
So ye, I dupe at spawn
The moment I get shurikens + bombs + dupe setup material, I tp back
setup everything and then rush the order I said before So you get into
corruption, Get 2 shadow scale/demonite ore TP back (dupe them + musket
ammo) Get into jungle, kill hornets/slime jungle with the musket for
stingers if you didnt get them before on your way to hell grab you
obsidian with your bombs Go in hell, get hellforge + hellstone Tp back
\> craft Fiery Greatsword + BoG Rush dungeon and get every last thing
done (edited)
I said I would, so i'll do it @Max Overpower

the unseeded versions are just hidden at the moment. I can only really
show one main part at a time. There could be a time in the future where
we show experts primarily, etc. but for now it's normal seeded. I like
rotating it so people don't get tired looking at the same numbers

bored
ye but, crab, if there's no block to catch on, he'll fall down and will
have some trouble to gain speed toward you again (edited)
But if you get correct spawn (right on your left/right. Or beneath you)
you could place 6 wood platform and destroy every parts in 2 mythical
vilethorn shot
And\* let him climb back up some platform and do that until he's dead
One rotation kill in some sort

Alright so im testing it up and i gotta say it's actually really hard to
be consistent without anything but titanium set + clockwork no modifier
no silver bullet
And titanium repeater + frostburn arrow has a better dps at ground
Except if you get holy arrows
Then it's a free kill before he get the time to go away
if anyone want to test it out, here's a world with a character equiped
with the minimal set

Make sure to back up your 1.3.5.3 files. So that you can still run 1.3.5
if you want.

Tbh I don't really like when speedrun community separates itself from

strats) so I most likely will just move on with 1.3.6

@PsiOnyx You can do it
![tvgbOk](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/377210896524771348.png "tvgbOk")
Maybe your hotbar is not optimized or you're not using the auto cursor
Or maybe you're loosing too much time duping useless items
You should not worry about armor unless you have no hearts (edited)
Some potions duping is useless too. You need only those : water walking,
feather fall, regeneration, armor, swiftness, shine. (edited)
Improve your inventory management by reducing your amount of items
overall.
Maybe you could not pick up trash items in chests too. It's hard to
trash items and, at the same time, navigate through caves/jungle
(edited)
Make yourself a list of items you may want to pick from chests. Recall
potions, torches, buff potions, glowstick, dynamite, bombs and, if
there's one, the main item. Mirror/boomstick/usefull accessory (or
useless one for their modifier if you're not full already, but then you
should equip it immediately) Note that some wooden chests are useless to
check if you're already full on iron/swiftness potion/torches. Don't
loose time on those when you're going for jungle unless they are on your
way without any detour (edited)
Dont bother checking for useless accessories modifier if you're full
already. Unless you're running for some ultimate WR, you should not try
to remember accessories modifier yet.
Hell, there's enough things to improve already
TL;DR : **Dont dupe useless things** AND use smart cursor for fast pick
up on chests item if you're in hurry

Should i waste time doing door dupe for iron if i come across it at

1Lomi 28-May-18 01:57 AM
I dont think you should start duping iron if you have nothing else to
dupe
Unless
Meh no nvm, you still need bombs for EoW
For optimal runs you should not start duping unless you have bombs. So
ye, if you get bombs + shurikens or grenades but not enough irons, you
should door dupe
and then rush EoW
At this point if you have no heart, then ye, dupe your iron too and make
yourself an armor set
It's ok to ease things for the run (duping armor, potions....) but now
you're used to run, you should be able to pass on those things and go
straight for your main objective.
Sometime it pays off not to back instantly though
Getting a hook is probably one of the few things you may want to get
before EoW
It speed up so much things

If I start the record, create the character & world, then start the
world but when the world was starting, the game crash, does it still
count if I just cut the record, re-launch the game and start again (Not
creating a new world but continuing the world I just created?)

if it's seeded, make a new world (it'll be the same obviously) if it's
random, make a new world (random world is the same as a random world.)

Hi, I'm interested in starting to speedrun terraria and I have some
questions.
Can you add the timer after recording?
Is this video quality good enough?

Video quality is quite good I won't say anything about timer after run
tho, haven't done like that and do not actually recall rules on that

Can I put the timer AFTER the video ? Like in the montage ? 'cause I'm
not using OBS to record & the programs I use cannot put the game AND the
timer at the same time.

Don't avoid watching and copying already successful speedruns You'll
learn basic strats and slowly generate your own

Dr.Robotnik 29-May-18 04:29 PM
of the 4 main category, all pre hardmode bosses and nights edge seeded
is a great place to start

I recently got into the 'Doing a random Pre-HM boss in 1 day', so I
decided to check speedrunning.com for terraria
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/200602635714297856/b6356ced20be15c58bb8bb178e72e52c.png)
Dr.Robotnik 29-May-18 04:30 PM
the beginning of the game has been refined a lot over the last month or
so to be pretty consistent, and the strat is pretty similar in both runs
(death of bee and skeletron, tp away from brain after you have the 2
specific drops in the nights edge run)
id recommend starting with seeded. it will get you used to moving around
and fighting the bosses consistently so that way when you do unseeded
there is a lot less figuring out what you need to be doing

indeed, its required for both seeded and unseeded.

@AirGuitarist @tvgBadger and @BandsWithLegends im not sure why, but when
i click on streams on the speedrun.com page for terraria speed runs it
doesnt come up with anything, yet checking over on twitch it does show
many people are streaming. does this have to do with the specific
settings looking for the 1.3.x patch? might help some people out who
actually run and those looking for active runners.

Also, if anyone is interested in voluenteering to verify runs in

@BandsWithLegends or @tvgBadger a message and we will have a quick chat.
@Dr.Robotnik okay so it works is:

can tick this option on their settings

oh, so its a personal setting, not a page setting. i guess thats logical
so you dont get bombarded with casuals
we should pin that

11icecube11 02-Jun-18 08:44 AM
Its not even a super amount of luck
At least 2 Bombs (Or 2 Dynamite) Grenades (Although, Throwing knifes,
shurikens or maybe Jester Arrows + Gold Bow might work) Enough Iron to
dupe stuff.
All in about 4-5 minutes,
Plus you gotta find corruption

Hello guys, can I do a run on "tModLoader"? I have modded game (For runs
I will disable them) and I dont want to remove modloader (.exe file
which replaced the original Terraria.exe).
If I disable all mods, I have vanilla version so only diference is the
.exe file which I using for playing the game. No gameplay changes

I would suggest just having a second install directory of Terraria that
is purely vanilla.

Vibel 06-Jun-18 02:20 PM
it is, you just have to launch the other version directly from the
install directory
as long as you have steam running it's fine

You can just replace exe file
Have vanilla and modded one in same folder and rename odd one to
something else

But still, is it allowed or not? Maybe better to write it to rules, I

Its probably Safer to run it on a vanilla version.

It depends on where you open the door. Click the top part of the door
Try the middle
Or the bottom
It should be the top. If that doesn‚Äôt work try the other two

I think turning ingame music a bit down so you don't notice it but it's
hearable, while using external source of custom music like phone, could
work

@PsiOnyx yea, it's tough. You can match your time and even do better, I
bet ![üòÉ](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png "üòÉ") there's
always something to try and work on, but sometimes you have to shift
your focus, learn something from the new run, and take it back to your
old one
so many huge time saves come from trying something new and/or weird and
putting it into somewhere where it doesn't seem to belong
just make sure whatever your doing is fun and your enjoying yourself

If you get lucky you could also drop the summoning item that scales with

As soon you kill the WoF It would become a huge dps maker
It's a rare drop
Some 0.01% from every single monsters in the game

I played around a little
Used the leveled mod
Holy hecc
Okay do
So
Zombies deal over 50 damage
And with leveled mod, you start with 75
Revengeance mode on
Not death mode
Early game is super hard
Kill bunnies to pretty much level up super fast
And dig straight down and mine the good ores
Early game. Focus on leveling up your damage and health
You will get 1 shot... a lot
Now with death mode on
Slimes 1 shot you (edited)
So
Avoid everything
Legit even with good armor and damage... EoC will destroy you if you
touch the base
So you think terraria isn‚Äôt hard enough? Turn on critical mode and start
with 1 heart (25 health) and reduce the amount of exp you get by 100%
Critical mode pretty much takes even more health away, you take more
damage. But you get more exp per kill
So
@tvgBadger do a stream of all of this. Just a casual playthrough
Literal hell

In my on going moon lord guide I wrote this @Cass - Small : For obvious
reasons. There's no point in going for medium or large worlds. Even if
you have teleportation potions during your run, you will eventually lose
time to Plantera and the pillars (**I'm talking about ML runs only eh**)
- Crimson : It's hardly open to debate since both crimson and corruption
drop bullets\* on the first orb break. but Crimson has 2 more things to
offer : you can easily dodge its terrain modification with only a few
platforms while the corruption may give you a hard time with its large
pits as well as theirs randomness. Also, the Crimson have better spawn
rate. Somehow the corruption (underground) has a really bad spawn rate,
which may make you fail a run because you did not get a single Rotten
Flesh drop. So you'll prefer Crimson over Corruption every time. For
your own experience, I invite you to try out both and see which is
better (edited)

It is....
To make things easier (or harder) I used the leveled mod so I can make
progress by mining
Pretty much my route is Spawn and mine trees Find some ores that are
above ground and mine (to level up) Dig straight down (or find a near
cave) Mine lead ore and above (to keep leveling up) Run around and try
to level up and find chests with accessories Find Susp eye Keep leveling
up Now go find weapons. And that‚Äôs my route so far.......
Any tips?

@Bobbyfrost I would watch videos and see what people have been using.
There are potential glitches that haven't necessarily been accepted by
the community. Feel free to discuss anything you've found here, or if
you'd like to keep it secret (hint: it won't stay a secret) you can
message me directly and I'll promise to shut up about it, but when I
verify your video everyone will be able to see it, regardless of if I
don't say anything
It's a really tough spot to mod speedrunning. People want to use
everything they can to get the best times, but there are simply things
that people consider 'cheating' vs a 'glitch.' If you're thinking of
using something that you've never seen before, the safe bet is to check
with a moderator to see where they stand as far as cheating vs glitch.
There's no way to make a hard and fast rule for this, as strategies and
routes are always evolving, and what one person may think of as
'too-much' may be accepted by the other members of the community. Aka,
check yourself before you wreck yourself

I've had this idea, I'm sure no one here would do this, but if you show
the seed before the run you could get someone else to route the seed
before you start the run. So you could either show the seed after, or
ignore this because no one would do this.
Just an idea

If she submitted her runs, it'd be great to talk to her and see what
she's up to, but until then I can't approve something that hasn't been
submitted. Technically, having a gold watch on isn't technically a
timer, and it would need to be un-doctored footage of the run. And
everything we have on youtube has been altered (obviously)

wut
You can search for a world with all different paiting
![üòÆ](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f62e.png "üòÆ")
There is a "Very near enchanted sword" setting you can add
It's a very very nice mod
I'll try my first search
Allright so ye, it generates world in chain and check your conditions
For as many worlds as you can
It's far better than manual search
anyway

The mod is heavily focused on pyramids though ahahah
You can search starting from anyseed and then it increments itself. So I
tried to search for the enchanted sword world we use
and ye it found it and saved it
![üëå](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44c.png "üëå")
It works
Oh

1Lomi 14-Jun-18 11:15 AM
Well, it does not work the way we would like to.
It uses a point system (all around pyramids) and ignore everything else.
Including "very near enchanted sword"
There might be a problem, i'll comment the thread to be sure

rare generations. You only to omit every rare to exclude all those. And
voila (edited)
Starting at the 908.... seed

I'll probably let it run all night only to see how long it takes to find

Speedrunning is up to what you want to do really

I would usually recommend shorter runs to get started out though
As it helps practice basic things
And it‚Äôs less of a time commitment

btw you read the post in forum? sadly those plantera bulb positions
should be random. They have some conditions but here are too many
positions which are valid. Strange it generates often at the same place.

Anyway, that's why I asked about the bulbs
Because by some hard tests I managed to see the bulb spawn in the same
location many times on the same map

Yeah, surprisingly speedrun.com nets quite a bit of views on videos (at
least what beta studio of youtube says so), probably people trying to
learn strats on respective bosses
Guess it works even better with twitch since there is only one thing to
follow/watch being live stream

If you dont mind having an internet connexion, you can put your
"tmodloader" rar in your steamapp folder, so when you want to play
terraria you go in steam \> terraria \> properties \> verify game cache
(That will download back the correct exe). And when you want to play
modded, you only to re-extract the rar
The exe file is not that heavy so you can download it within seconds

Is it OK if you also need to mine some blocks to reach a good item? E.g.
you need to mine a dirt block or as alternative you can go a way around
which is not blocked. Would you go around if that alternative way is 50
blocks longer, or only 40 longer? or 30? 20? 10? 5? How long can that
way be to avoid mining that dirt block?

@Unftf It's hard to give you an answer on this one. Only by practice
you'll know the which is the best. It depends of your accessories, the
distance, your amount of platform, the biome you're in, the amount of
mobs that could be around... We can't give you any tips on this

This is the folder that manages worlds/players and mods for the
TmodLoader launcher
You have nothing to do with it
When you play vanilla, it saves in the folder you can see there
(Players/Wolrds)
But when you play Modded, it will save in the ModLoader folder
It's only saves, not the exe (edited)
When you extract the tmodloader rar, you put it in the steam folder
right ?
Where the exe is located

@Yui-chan @11icecube11 @WitherKOO From the rules in the speedrun.com 1.
Timers must be shown, When recording runs, a suitable 3rd-party timer
must be present on screen. Your timer must be accurate to at least 1
second and clearly visible at all times. Use this link to find timers
and how to use them with various streaming programs:
[https://www.speedrun.com/resources](https://www.speedrun.com/resources)
Timers start when you have control of your your character when the world
loads and should end when your run objective is met. You may NOT add a
timer afterwards. It would be easy to speed-up/slow-down/splice videos
if you did this. The in-game timer isn't very accurate, especially
because of things like lag and entering/exiting the game.

@Yui-chan I'll check them out and see. It's mainly for people who are
competing for the top spots, where seconds can decide 1st, 2nd, etc, but
we have to keep the rules the same for everyone. If a couple seconds
isn't a huge difference, it'll probably be fine, but please do NOT add a
timer in afterwards

@11icecube11 that's computer/terraria/server lag. When you're doing
multiplayer, terraria has to connect to the server when you enter the
world, so there's some lag associated with that. totally normal. start
your timer when you gain control of your character

@Yui-chan just to let you know, from what I've seen the in-game timer is
usually faster than a timer, but exiting the world sometimes loses you a
second or two, I'll time it myself later and see what I get, but that's
the usual outcome.
you're good ![üòÉ](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f603.png "üòÉ") let
me know what's holding you up with livesplit. It's a really great tool
and will help you know how long things are taking in your game. Since
night/day are such an important part to speedrunning, it's great to be
able to have the timers on screen while you run (and is also required)

@BandsWithLegends played calamity mod and casual played to see how fast
I can be to get to tremode. Dude it took so long (without speedrunning)
So I understand 12 hours
So if I was @tvgBadger . An hour on Moon lord. It would be roughly 3
more hours for devourer of gods?
4 hour run?

good luck
it took me 40-50 hours to beat DoG xd
been a while since I played terraria though
and using speedrunning stuff will save a bunch of time
Was it revengence mode?
cause normal mode would be much easier
Moon lord to DoG shouldn't take that long though
the only major bosses are providence and polterghast
neither of which are too bad

BandsWithLegends 01-Jul-18 05:33 AM
@Pears the run is way different, so an hour to moon lord isn't standard
for it. Also, I don't know if seeds are the same, so add at least a half
hour onto that. Especially because a lot of pre-ML stuff was grinding
for items and dealing with different/harder enemies
I think DoG was 6 hours, true calamitas (whichever the last one is) was
like 10/11, but I can't even remember if I beat it

faster than the posted 11:33, but its too close to call from my

Another thing to note is that you need to show the seed, even on random
runs. This is for world verification
The same thing happened with the random run, your run is probably about

and don't worry about these kinds of things, I've had to remind roughly
+90% of runner about stuff like this, or submitting their run to the
wrong category, etc. I've had to redo like 10-15 of my own submissions
because I can't read

it does help your run in case someone thinks it is suspicious though.

Well the gaurdians should be mini bosses since you have to fight them
during DoG
Also instead of farming for chaos fish you could just briefly turn on
the charm that gives it a 5% drop rate
And if you have a Zerg potion
It will drop pretty quick
Or just be lucky like me and get two drops of it
Somehow
Despite never getting it in vanilla

the king slime, your dps will be far higher than the beenades

She usually try to come back to you as fast as sanic. If you're in her
range of attack (some 400 tiles or idk) she lock you again and won't
despawn. That's why even if you die, you should run toward the jungle as
it can make the differences between her despawning or not

you can also just create new worlds and do the fishing quest
but yeah 200 is really dumb
Cause it's not like you're probably going to do it every day
on a new character it will probably take a bit of time to get the angler
unless you bum rush for him
even then you need the merchant to get bait
and find viable pools of water
and it takes a while early game since you'll probably have bad fishing
gear

I always said that sam was op. Thanks to LoTR
Well it won't carry you for ever though.
Gotta test it. And find it too
I think you destroy everything up to ML
I dont know if you can burst ML down with a rod of discord + that weapon
That's a pretty neat discover thought
![üë∫](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f47a.png "üë∫")
It was "a Revengeance-exclusive weapon dropped by The Devourer of Gods."
so I guess you can destroy most of things with that

Well,it is 100% dodge since you teleport far away and all shit
disappears, but that hits dps either way

Roofon 12-Jul-18 05:02 PM
2 natural drops actually
Yeah dps would be a problem
But it‚Äôs better than dying
You could use the home potions instead btw
Since the use time is shorter

You certainly would need pick-up weapon postml, lomi Also most likely
you will craft Phangasm postdoggo
And then go for any of exo which is grind x10

the slime or Deus
none of them are needed for Yharon, right ?

ACTUALLY
WAIT
You could get easy bloodstone
Kill them and then kill providence
Open bags
They‚Äôll have bloodstone
So
Easy bloodstone armor
If you want
But that is probably not necessary
Sorry for the caps
