> You need a Raven Staff (or any kind of minion that cannot pass through blocks), and a Slimy Saddle for receiving invulnerability to dodge Ice Queen's attacks. After summoning two ravens into crab chamber, activate the dummy hoik engine (credit: [@DicemanX](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/1706/)) via the top right switch. You can collect boosters and replenish mana indefinitely without mana potion (credit: [@blackshadowwind](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/36525/)). You can stack 2 dummies in the same spot by pressing the switch on the bottom right (credit: [@inomanoms](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/19464/)). In order to receive complete invulnerability, you need to bounce off at least 2 dummies. The top left switch activates the spawn surfaces, and the bottom left switch lets you teleport back to the base.

> My goal was to spawn Pumpkings and Ice Queens as far as possible and make them form a straight line, so that I can kill them before they reach me. I came up with this setup thanks to [Umami Ayataka](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpTr94fA0e1HJEopg0XrOxQ), who is the first to bring up the idea of setting the spawn surfaces diagonally beneath the player in [his (or her) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGtvvLryCy0). What I did in addition was block unnecessary spawn surfaces with lava, so that mobs can spawn only from 72 tiles to 84 tiles away.

> It works perfectly for Pumpkin moon. If you're careful, Pumpkings never reach you even when you have to reload the Last Prism (which lasts only a minute in a continuous way). If you get extremely lucky, you might able to reach final wave before 8:00 pm. It's just a matter of when and how many Mourning Woods spawn from wave 4, and Pumpkings from wave 7.

> What troubles me is Ice Queen, for she seems to gradually evade the Last Prism's ray. You can check it in my videos that Ice Queen tries to pass beneath the player if you keep hitting her from the moment she spawned, otherwise she tries to passes through (or even over) the player. So you need to shift the ray down a bit to kill her within the staircase, and which means you can't kill multiple Ice Queens within the staircase unless they are overlapping, or at least fairly close to each other.  
> I used Slimy Saddle invulnerability machine, to dodge attacks from Ice Queen I failed to kill within the staircase and not to freeze. You have to be careful when you kill her within the staircase while you already have one flying overhead. If you shift the ray down too much, you hit the dummy and your invulnerability frame breaks off (Like 6:32 and 9:28 of my video). Thanks to the indication of [@stefnotch](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/32714/) and [@inomanoms](https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/19464/) in [this thread](http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/thoughts-on-dummy-engineering-updated-1-2-16.39796/), I can now stack 2 dummies in the exact same spot. No need to worry about too much shifting anymore!![:happy:](https://forums.terraria.org/assets/emoticons/guide/happy.png "Happy    :happy:")
