# The ALL-BOSS challenge
> So some time ago I built arenas to destroy all the pre-hardmode bosses simultaneously, and to destroy hardmode bosses simultaneously, but I often wondered if I could merge the two and fight all the bosses together. After many months of putting it off, I finally started working on this a few days ago, and after many trials and test runs, I finally succeeded. The ALL-BOSS challenge is as follows:
> 
> 1) Bosses must all be summoned first before any bosses are killed  
> 2) Bosses can only die once the player goes AFK, not before  
> 3) No glitches, exploits, or bugs can be used (specifically no dungeon spikes or mob statues to mitigate damage are allowed, and hoiks are not allowed either)
> 
> This challenge is definitely not so simple, mainly because of the need to summon the Wall of Flesh, Plantera, and Duke Fishron. The good news is that Fishron can be summoned even in the cavern layer, but then the player needs to drop down to the underworld to summon the WoF otherwise bad things will happen. The Plantera bulb fortunately can spawn on any jungle surface, and will eventually spawn on all free jungle surfaces separated by 150-300 blocks from any other bulbs.

> Survival is also not so easy since the slime statue exploit is not permitted in this challenge. This means the player has to lean on heart statues since even teleporting around will not stop Plantera and Fishron from hurting the player significantly. The problem is that all the bosses drop hearts upon death, which can block heart spawns from statues since there's a limit of 10 anywhere in the world. This necessitates using lava to burn fallen hearts. Still, King Slime can spawn in the ocean where Duke Fishron is summoned, so it's also tricky to destroy the hearts there - I managed to do it with a loch system that allows items to fall to lava from the bottom of the ocean.

> Now the question is whether I can add the Dungeon Guardian into the mix, even though the Dungeon Guardian is not a "real" boss. Unfortunately moon event bosses cannot be added because they are incompatible with the Wall of Flesh, but I'll post separate challenges for Moon events + hardmode bosses.
